--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example application(s) built with 'lazarus-ide'. See 'http://www.lazarus-ide.org/'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FPC version: 3.0.0
Lazarus version: 1.6


For Ubuntu:
-----------
Download from 'www.sourceforge.net':

  - 'fpc_3.0.0-NNN_MMM.deb'
  - 'fpc-src_3.0.0-NNN_MMM.deb'
  - 'lazarus_1.6-NNN_MMM.deb'

Install deb packages with:

  - sudo dpkg -i <nnn.deb>

Start 'lazarus-ide' and open existing project or create a new. Use 'canlib.pas' to interface
Kvaser linuxcan.

NOTES:
  - Currently there is no support for the 'canlib.pas' for Linux Lazarus, as it is
    merely an experiment and example.
  - The function declarations in 'canlib.pas' must match 'canlib.h'. Especially
    one must consider that 'long' and 'size_t' may be 64-bit types on 64-bit
    PC's. Thus one cannot simply use the 'canlib.pas' for Linux 64-bit and use it as it
    is in a Windows 64-bit OS.
  - The file 'canlib.pas' is modified from the Windows Delphi version provided by Kvaser AB.
    Beware that all functions are not tested and that there may be errors. If a function
    call does not seem to work, check with corresponding constants and function declarations
    in 'canlib.h'.
